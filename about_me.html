    <h2>Travel Memories</h2>
    <p>This summer, I traveled to Tokyo and Izu with friends. These are two very different cities. Tokyo is bustling and crowded, a true metropolis. But Izu feels more like a scene from a Japanese anime—a quiet, warm countryside.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Pet Names</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cat named "Awu"</li>
        <li>A dog named "Momo"</li>
        <li>A bird named "Jojo"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oleana/@42.3705494,-71.0997608,844m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e370b2d41372af:0xae84228b09fd944f!8m2!3d42.3705494!4d-71.0971859!16s%2Fm%2F0k0bjrg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">Oleana</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This Mediterranean restaurant offers an incredible dining experience with its innovative Middle Eastern cuisine and warm, intimate atmosphere. The outdoor garden seating is absolutely magical, especially during summer evenings. I'm particularly drawn to their creative use of spices and fresh ingredients, and their lamb dishes are simply outstanding. The service is impeccable, and every visit feels like a special occasion.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    <img src="figure/IMG_6242.JPG" alt="My favorite food" class="food-image">
    <p>My favorite food is hot pot! I like gathering around a steaming hot pot with friends during cold winters. I usually choose fresh beef slices, tofu, mushrooms, and various vegetables. I enjoy dipping the ingredients in the pot and then dipping them in special sesame sauce and garlic paste.</p>
